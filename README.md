# CAG-Project-API
This project is a backend API developed using FastAPI. It gives you the ability to chat with your documents by uploading them and asking questions based on their content.  The term **CAG** stands for **Cache Argumented Generation**. The model stores your document text in a temporary memory (a cache) to use as context when answering your queries.
